## Specification

**Note: Remember this is a C project.**

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. 

1. Recall the following references, which will still be useful throughout the rest of the course.
    * [Learn C in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c/)
    * [C Cheat Sheet](https://www.cheatography.com/ashlyn-black/cheat-sheets/c-reference/)
    * [C Programming Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming)
    * [Learn Make in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/make/)
1. Examine the source code in ```src/matrix``` carefully. Finish coding the implementation.
    1. In a Jupyter notebook ```Matrix.ipynb```, describe how the ```MATRIX``` type is defined and how it works in detail. Explain in particular how the rows and columns of a multidimensional array are stored in C.
    1. Explain how you could force C to use "column-major ordering" if desired.
    1. Make sure that ```test_matrix``` in the ```test/``` folder compiles and runs correctly after you are finished implementing ```MATRIX```.
